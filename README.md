# Audio-Cutter-Bot
Telegram bot available by nickname @Cutter_Audio_bot (https://t.me/Cutter_Audio_bot).

There was a problem - with long podcasts on YouTube, the video itself is not needed and I want to turn off the screen. 
The bot solves the problem with the inability to lock the screen when listening to a video on YouTube. This bot does the following: it takes a link to a YouTube video and cuts the audio track.
In the "tests" folder there is a script with unit tests covering the functions.
